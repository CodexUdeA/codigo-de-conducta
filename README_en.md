<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Codex UdeA - Code of Conduct üìå</h1>

## Why a code of conduct?

A primary goal of `Codex` is to be inclusive to the largest number of
members, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we
are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic
status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in
our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in `Codex` to help us create safe and
positive experiences for everyone.

## Expected Behavior ü§ù

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in       distress,
  or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another
  person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory
  jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation,
  race, religion, or disability.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;
  inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers
will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (organizers, members, speakers, sponsors and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications
pertaining to community business.
